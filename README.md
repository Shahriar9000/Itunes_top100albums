### Tasks

-   Implement assignment using:
    -   Language: **TypeScript**
    -   Framework: **Angular**
-   Show top 100 albums based on the json feed here: `https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/topalbums/limit=100/json`
-   Cross browser support (or graceful degradation)
-   A clean modern look and responsive design
-   A good user experience
-   Use a CSS Framework (Bootstrap, Foundation, Pure, etc.â€¦)
-   Allow the top 100 to be searchable
-   Add a feature that you think would work well here (for instance, advanced search, integration with other API, a "Favorite" functionality)
    -   Describe the feature in separate markdown file

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **TypeScript** best practices
-   We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program.
-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
-   Testing: is the system adequately tested?
